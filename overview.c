// The shell will work only in interactive mode (no scripts, i.e. the executable takes no arguments)
// Run simple commands with absolute, relative path (e.g. /bin/ls, ../bin/ls)
// Run simple commands without a path (e.g. ls, cat, grep, etc…)
// Have a working history (you can navigate through commands with up/down arrows)
// Implement pipes (|)
// Implement redirections (<, >, >>)
// Implement the here-doc (<<)
// Handle double quotes ("") and single quotes (''), which should escape special characters, beside $ for double quotes.
// Handle environment variables ($ followed by a sequence of characters).
// Handle signals like in bash (ctrl + C, ctrl + \, ctrl + D).
// Implement the following built-ins:
// — echo (option -n only)
// — exit
// — env (with no options or arguments)
// — export (with no options)
// — unset (with no options)
// — cd
// — pwd
// And for the bonus part (optional, but i did it, because it’s cool!)
// — handle && and || with the parenthesis () for priority.
// — handle * wildcards for the current working directory.
